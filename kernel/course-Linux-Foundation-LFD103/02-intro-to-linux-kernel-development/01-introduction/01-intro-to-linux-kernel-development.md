## $\textnormal{Introduction to Linux Kernel Development Process}$

> - In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the Linux <br />
    Kernel development process, and we will learn how small <br />
    incremental changes (`patches`) sent to a mailing list get <br />
    included in the upstream kernel.
