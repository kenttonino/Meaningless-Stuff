## $\textnormal{Course Support}$
> - One great way to interact with peers taking this course is via the Class Forum.

> - Class Forum: https://forum.linuxfoundation.org/categories/lfd103-class-forum

> - The forum can be used in the following ways.

```plaintext
- To introduce yourself to other peers taking this course.

- To discuss concepts, tools and technologies presented in this course, or related
  to the topics discussed in the course materials.

- To ask questions or report issues with labs or course content.

- To share resources and ideas related to Linux Kernel development.
```

> - The class forum will be reviewed periodically by the Linux Foundation staff, <br />
    but it is primarily a community resource, not an `ask the instructor` service.
