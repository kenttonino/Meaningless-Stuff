## $\textnormal{Course Timing}$

> - This course is entirely self-paced; there is no fixed schedule for going <br />
    through the material. You can go through the course at your own pace, <br />
    and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you <br />
    come back to start a new session.

> - However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, <br />
    as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

> - You have unlimited access to this course for 12 months from the date you <br />
    registered, even after you have completed the course.

> - The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It <br />
    is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only <br />
    skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed <br />
    you have not been exposed to yet.

> - But this is all self-paced, and you can always go back, so you can thread <br />
    your own path through the material.
