## $\textnormal{Testing Open Source Software}$

> - Ensuring software is stable without regressions before the <br />
    release helps avoid debugging and fixing customer- and <br />
    user-found bugs after the release.

> - It costs more in time and effort to debug and fix a <br />
    customer-found problem.

> - Hence, testing is very important when it comes to any <br />
    software, not just the Linux kernel.

> - Unlike closed and proprietary operating systems, the <br />
    development process is open. and is not locked down.

> - This process is its strength, as well as its weakness.

> - With several developers continuing to add new features, <br />
    and fixing bugs, continuous integration and testing is <br />
    vital to ensure the kernel continues to work on existing <br />
    hardware as new hardware support and features get added.

> - In the open source development model, developers and users <br />
    share the testing responsibility.

> - This is another important difference between a closed <br />
    development model and an open one.

> - The majority of Linux kernel developers, if not all, are <br />
    very active Linux users themselves.

> - There is no requirement that testers should be developers.

> - However, users and developers that are not familiar with <br />
    the new code may be more effective at testing a new piece <br />
    of code than the original author of that code.

> - In other words, while developer testing serves as an <br />
    important step in verifying the functionality of the software,
    developer testing alone is not sufficient to find <br />
    interactions with other code, features, and unintended <br />
    regressions on configurations and/or hardware, the developer <br />
    did not anticipate and did not have the opportunity and <br />
    resources to test.

> - Hence, users play a very important role in the Linux Kernel <br />
    development process.
