> - The `Linux Kernel` is the result of collaborative development efforts from developers
    across the globe.

> - Small incremental changes, also known as `patches`, add new features, make
    enhancements, and fix bugs.

> - It is a 24-hour, seven days a week, and 365 days of continuous development process
    that results in a new release once every 2+ months, and several stable and extended
    stable releases once a week. New development and current release integration cycles
    run in parallel.

> - A new release comes out once a every 10 to 11 weeks. Releases are time-based rather
    than feature-based. That means releases are not held up for features. There is no
    set date for these releases.
