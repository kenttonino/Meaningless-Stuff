`Model`
#

> - A computer program that can make predictions or decisions.
> - Machine learning models lears from data.
> - An LLM is a model that has learned from a diverse and vast amount of text data, called `Corpus`.

<br />

`Training`
#

> - The process of making a model learn from data so it can make better predictions and decisions.
> - Different models are trained for different tasks.
> - For a model to be ready to use, it first needs to be trained.

Machine learning uses two approaches:
#

(1) **Supervised Learning** <br />
(2) **Unsupervised Learning**
