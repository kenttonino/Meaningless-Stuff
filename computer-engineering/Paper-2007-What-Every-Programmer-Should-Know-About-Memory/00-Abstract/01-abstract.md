# Abstract

> - As CPU cores become both faster and more numerous, the limiting factor for most programmers is now, and will be for some time, memory access.
> - Hardware designers have come up with ever more sophisticated memory handling and acceleration techniques - such as CPU caches - but these cannot work optimally without some help from the programmer.
> - This paper explains the structure of memory subsystems in use on modern commodity hardware, illustrating why CPU caches were developed, how they work, and what programs should do to achieve optimal performance by utilizing them.
