## $\textnormal{Gain Better Understanding of Architecture}$

> - Working at the assembly language level provides a richer <br />
    understanding of the underlying computer architecture.

> - This includes the basic instruction set, processor register <br />
    memory addressing, hardware interfacing, and IO.

> - Since ultimately all programs execute at this level, knowing <br />
    the capabilities of assembly language provides useful insights <br />
    into what is possible, what is easy, and what might be more <br />
    difficult or slower.
