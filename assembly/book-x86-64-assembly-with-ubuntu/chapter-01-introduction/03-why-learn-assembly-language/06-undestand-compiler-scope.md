## $\textnormal{Understand Compiler Scope}$

> - Programming with assembly language, after having already <br />
    learned a high-level language, helps ensure programmers <br />
    understand the scope and capabilities of a compiler.

> - Specifically, this means learning what the compiler does <br />
    and does not do in relation to the computer architecture.
