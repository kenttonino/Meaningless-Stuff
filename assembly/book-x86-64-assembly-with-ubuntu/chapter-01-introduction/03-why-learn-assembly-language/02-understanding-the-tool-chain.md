## $\textnormal{Understanding the Tool Chain}$

> - `Tool chain` is the name for the process of taking code written <br />
    by a human and converting it into something that a computer can <br />
    directly use.

> - This includes `compiler`, or `assembler` in our case, the `linker`, <br />
    the `loader`, and the `debugger`.
