## $\textnormal{Why Learn Assembly Language}$

> - Understanding how a computer works instead of developing large programs.

> - Since assembly language is machine specific, the lack of portability <br />
    is very limiting for programming projects.

> - The process of actually learning assembly language involves writing <br />
    non-trivial programs to perform specific low-level actions including <br />
    arithmetic operations, function calls, using stack-dynamic local <br />
    variables, and operating system interaction for activities such as IO.
