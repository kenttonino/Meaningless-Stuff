## $\textnormal{Gain an Understanding of I/O Buffering}$

> - In a high-level language, input/output instructions and the <br />
    associated buffering operations can appear magical.

> - Working at the assembly language level and performing some <br />
    low-level input/output operations provides a more detailed <br />
    understanding of how input/output and buffering really works.

> - This includes the differences between interactive input/output, <br />
    file input/output, and the associated operating system services.
