## $\textnormal{What is Assembly}$

> - Assembly language is machine specific.

> - For example, code written for an `x86-64` processor will not run on <br />
    a different processor such as `RISC` processor (popular in tablets <br />
    and smart-phones).

> - Assembly language is a `low-level` language and provides the basic <br />
    instructional interface to the computer processor.

> - Assembly language is as close to the processor as you can get as a <br />
    programmer.

> - Programs written in a high-level language are translated into assembly <br />
    language in order for the processor to execute the program.

> - The high-level language is an abstraction between the language and the <br />
    actual processor instructions.

> - Assembly language gives you direct control of the system's resources.

> - This involves setting processor registers, accessing memory locations, <br />
    and interfacing with other hardware elements.
