## $\textnormal{Introduction}$

> - The `x86-64` is a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) CPU Design.

> - This refers to the internal processor design philosophy.

> - `CISC` processors typically include a wide variety of instructions <br />
    (sometimes overlapping), varying instructions sizes, and a wide range <br />
    of addressing modes.

> - The term was retroactively coined in contrast to Reduced Instruction <br />
    Set Computer (RISC).
