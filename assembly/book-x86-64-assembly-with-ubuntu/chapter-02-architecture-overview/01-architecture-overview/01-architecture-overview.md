## $\textnormal{Architecture Overview}$

> - The basic components of computer include a `Central Processing Unit (CPU)`, <br />
    `Primary Storage` or `Random Access Memory (RAM)`, `Secondary Storage`, <br />
    `Input/Output devices` (screen, keyboard, mouse, etc.), and an interconnection <br />
    referred to as the `Bus`.

> - The architecture is typically referred to as the `Von Neumann Architecture`, <br />
    or the `Princeton Architecture`, and was described in 1945 by the <br />
    mathematician and physicist `John Von Neumann`.

> - Programs and data are typically stored on secondary storage (disk drive <br />
    or solid state drive).

> - When a program is executed, it must be copied from secondary storage <br />
    into the primary storage or main memory (RAM).

> - The `CPU` executes the program from the primary storage or `RAM`.

> - Primary storage or main memory is also referred to as volatile memory <br />
    since when power removed, the information is not retained and thus <br />
    lost.

> - Secondary storage is referred to as non-volatile memory since the information <br />
    is retained when powered off.

> - For example, consider storing a term paper on secondary storage (disk, etc.).

> - When the user starts to write or edit the term paper, it is copied from the <br />
    secondary storage medium into primary storage (RAM or main memory).

> - When done, the updated version is typically stored back to the secondary <br />
    storage (disk).

> - If you have ever lost power while editing a document, losing the unsaved <br />
    work will certainly clarify the difference between volatile and <br />
    non-volatile memory.
