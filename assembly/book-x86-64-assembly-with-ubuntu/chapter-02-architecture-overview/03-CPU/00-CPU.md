## $\textnormal{Central Processing Unit}$

> - The `CPU` is typically referred to as the `brains` of the <br />
    computer since that is where the actual calculations are <br />
    performed.

> - The `CPU` is housed in a single chip, sometimes called a <br />
    processor, chip, or die.

> - The `CPU` chip includes a number of functional units, including <br />
    the `Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)` which is part of the chip that <br />
    actually performs the arithmetic and logical calculations.

> - In order to support the `ALU`, processor registers and cache <br />
    memory are also included "on the die".

> - It should be noted that the internal design of a modern processor <br />
    is quite complex.
