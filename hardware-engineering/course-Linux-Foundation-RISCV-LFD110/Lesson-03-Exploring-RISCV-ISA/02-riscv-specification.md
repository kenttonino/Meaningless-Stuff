`RISC-V ISA`
#

> - It was defined while avoiding implementation details as much as possibble.
> - It should be read as the software-visible interface to a wide variety of implementation rather than as the design of a particular hardware artifact.

`RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume 1`
#

> - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uviu1nH-tScFfgrovvFCrj7Omv8tFtkp/view
> - Covers the design of the base unprivileged instructions, including optional unprivileged ISA extensions.
> - Unprivileged instructions are those that are generally usable in all privilege modes in all privileged architectures, though behavior might vary depending on privilege mode and privilege architecture.

`RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume II`

> - Provides the design of the first privileged architecture.

`RISC-V`
#

> - A seasoned architecture designed to succeed where others have failed in the past.
> - Designed as a modular ISA, as opposed to the traditional incremental ISAs in commercial processors like the ARM Cortex family.
