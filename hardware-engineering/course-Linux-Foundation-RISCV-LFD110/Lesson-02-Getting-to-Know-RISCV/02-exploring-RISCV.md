<br />

[`RISC Processor`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)
#

> - A short for Reduced Instruction Set Computer. <br />
> - First designed in the 1980s as an evolution of earlier designs.

<br />

In practice, RISC-V can refer to different things depending on context:
#

> - The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
> - The community of users and developers of the ISA.
> - RISC-V International, the organization that owns and maintains the ISA intellectual property.
> - The hardware and IP products that are built on the ISA.

# The RISC-V and Community

<br />

`RISC-V ISA`
#

> - An abstract model of a computer.
> - The specification for this set of instructions is the 5th generation of RISC processors, which have been developed since the 1980s.
> - Developed by community.

<br />

This ecosystem is composed of a wide variety of elements:
#

> - Physical hardware: Processors, development boards, System-on-Chips (SoCs), System-on-Modules (SoMs), and other physical systems.
> - Soft IP processor cores that can be loaded into emulators, FPGAs, or implemented in silicon.
> - The entire software stack, from bootloaders and firmware, up to full OS and applications.
> - Services including verification, custom board design, and many more.
