[`RISC Processor`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)
#

> - A short for Reduced Instruction Set Computer. <br />
> - First designed in the 1980s as an evolution of earlier designs.

<br />

In practice, RISC-V can refer to different things depending on context:
#

> - The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
> - The community of users and developers of the ISA.
> - RISC-V International, the organization that owns and maintains the ISA intellectual property.
> - The hardware and IP products that are built on the ISA.

# The RISC-V and Community

<br />

`RISC-V ISA`
#

> - An abstract model of a computer.
> - The specification for this set of instructions is the 5th generation of RISC processors, which have been developed since the 1980s.
> - Developed by community.

<br />

This ecosystem is composed of a wide variety of elements:
#

> - Physical hardware: Processors, development boards, System-on-Chips (SoCs), System-on-Modules (SoMs), and other physical systems.
> - Soft IP processor cores that can be loaded into emulators, FPGAs, or implemented in silicon.
> - The entire software stack, from bootloaders and firmware, up to full OS and applications.
> - Services including verification, custom board design, and many more.

`Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC)`
#

> - CISC CPUs have a fewer registers and lots of instructions, most of which have access to memory.
> - CISC instruction sets usually lots of instructions, many performing complicated calculations for specific tasks.
> - Example is Intel 80386 (first 32-bit processor) was launched in 1985 and supported over 150 instructions.

<br />

`Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)`
#

> - A computer architecture proposed in the early 1980s based on simplicity, as opposed to Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC).
> - Born in academic environment.
> - Have a lots of registers and a very modest instruction set, with memory access restricted to a few Load and Store instructions.
> - RISC instruction sets have a very modest number of simple, general-purpose instructions.
> - Example is RISC-V Base Integer ISA was released in 2010 and has only 40 instructions.
