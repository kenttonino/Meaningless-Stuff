| `Artificial Intelligence` |
| ------------------------- |
| The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. |

<br />

| Rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us. |

<br />

| `Neural Networks` |
| ----------------- |
| A form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data. |

<br />

| `Features` |
| ---------- |
| Information we always have. |
| Information we feed to the model. |

<br />

| `Label` |
| ------- |
