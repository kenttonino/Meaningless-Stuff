```

> - This class will enable you to begin writing embedded C language <br />
    firmware for microcontrollers.

> - Most major C language contructs will be covered, including <br />
    variables, contants, operators, expressions and statements, <br />
    decision functionality, loops, and, functions, arrays, multi-file <br />
    projects, and data pointers.

> - You will learn all of those C language topics from a non-hardware <br />
    framework so that you can focus on learning the C langauge instead <br />
    of the microcontroller architecture.

> - The presentation will be accompanied by instructor-led code <br />
    demonstrations that will be conducted with the powerful `MPLAB Simulator`.

> - Skills learned in this class will be applicable to any ANSI C compiler.

> - At the end of the class, you will have the opportunity to apply <br />
    your knowledge to program a microcontroller to perform basic input <br />
    and output functionality and control.

> - You will also use the `MPLAB X IDE` to perform actual debugging on <br />
    a microcontroller and execute some basic debugging techniques.

> - While not required, previous experience with any programming <br />
    language or experience with microcontrollers would be helpful.
