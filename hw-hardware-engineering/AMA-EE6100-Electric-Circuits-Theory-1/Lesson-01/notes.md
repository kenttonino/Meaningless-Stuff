## Charge

| `Electric Charge (Q)` |
| --------------------- |
| Most basic quantity in an electric circuit. |
| Fundamental property of matter that exhibit electrostatic attraction and repulsion. |
| Electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists. |

<br />

| `Coulumb (C)` |
| ------------- |
| Charge of 1 proton = $1.602 \ x \ 10^{-19} \ C$ |
| Charge of 1 electron = - $1.602 \ x \ 10^{-19} \ C$ |
| # of electrons in 1 C (disregard sign) = $\frac{{1 \ C}}{\normalsize{1.602 \ x \ 10^{-19} \ C / e}}$ = $6.242 \ x \ 10^{18}  \ e$ | 

| `Additional Information` |
| ------------------------ |
| The law of conservation of charge states that charge can neither be created or <br /> or destroyed but only transferred. |
| Thus, the algebraic sum of the electric charge in a system does not change. |
| It can be converted to another form of energy. |

## Current

| `Current (I)` |
| ------------- |
| The motion of charge through a conducting material or the time rate of change. |
| The current is measured in `ampere (A)`. |
| `Ampere` is the quantity of total charge that passes through an arbitrary cross <br /> section of conducting materials per unit second. |
| Formula: $I \ = \frac{\normalsize{Q}}{\normalsize{t}}$ |
| `I` is the current measured in `Ampere (A)`. |
