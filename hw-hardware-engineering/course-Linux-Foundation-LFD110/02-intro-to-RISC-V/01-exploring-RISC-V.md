## About RISC-V

| `RISC Processors` |
| ----------------- |
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer |
| Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), were first designed in the 1980s as an evolution of earlier designs. |

## The RISC-V ISA and Community

| `ISA` |
| ----- |
| Refers to Instruction Set Architecture. |
| An abstract model of a computer. |
| In this case, a `Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)`. |

<br />

> - The specification for this set of instructions is the 5th generation of RISC processors, which have been in development since the 1980s, thus we call it `RISC-V`.

| Developed by community. |

| `0pen Source RISC-V Ecosystem` |
| -------- |
| Physical hardware: processors, development boards, System-on-Chips (System-on-Chips), System-on-Modules (SoMs), and other physical systems. |
| "Soft" IP processor cores that can be loaded into emulators, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or implemented in silicion. |
| The entire software stack, from bootloaders and firmware, up to full operating systems and applications. |
