## $\textnormal{Linux Foundation}$

> - `The Linux Foundation` provides a neutral, trusted hub for developers to <br />
    code, manage, and scale open technology projects.

> - Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more than 1,000 <br />
    members and is the world's leading home for collaboration on open <br />
    source software, open standards, open data and open hardware.

> - The Linux Foundation's methodology  focuses on leveraging best practices <br />
    and addressing the needs of contributors, users and solution providers to <br />
    create sustainable models for open collaboration.

> - The Linux Foundation hosts Linux, the world's largest and most pervasive <br />
    open source software project in history. It is also home to Linux creator <br />
    Linus Torvalds and lead maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman.

> - The success of Linux has catalyzed growth in the open source community, <br />
    demonstrating the commercial efficacy of open source and inspiring <br />
    countless new projects across all industries and levels of the technology <br />
    stack.

> - As a result, the Linux Foundation today hosts far more than Linux; it is <br />
    the umbrella for many critical open source projects that power corporations <br />
    today, spanning virtually all industry sectors.

> - Some of the technologies we focus on include big data and analytics, <br />
    networking, embedded systems and IoT, web tools, cloud computing, edge <br />
    computing, automotive, security, blockchain, and many more.
