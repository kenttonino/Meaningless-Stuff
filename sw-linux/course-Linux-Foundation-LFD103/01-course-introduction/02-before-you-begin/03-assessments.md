## $\textnormal{Assessments}$

> - While not having lab exercises per se, this course is hands-on, and guides <br />
    you through the processes involved in Linux Kernel development.

> - At the end of each chapter, you will also find a series of knowledge check <br />
    questions. These questions, just like the labs, were designed with one main <br />
    goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce <br />
    what you have learned. We would also like to emphasize that you will not be <br />
    required to take a final exam to complete this course.
