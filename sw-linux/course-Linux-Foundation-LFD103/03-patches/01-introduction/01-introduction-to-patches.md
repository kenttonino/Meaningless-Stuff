## $\textnormal{Introduction to Patches}$

> - You are probably wondering what a change to the kernel looks like.

> - Changes to the kernel are normally called a `patch` after the name of the historical
    tool that works with incremental changes to a text file, likely originating in the
    patch used in stitching a quilt or mending a piece of clothing.

> - In this chapter, we will break down the patch into components and talk about the
    purpose for each one of them.
