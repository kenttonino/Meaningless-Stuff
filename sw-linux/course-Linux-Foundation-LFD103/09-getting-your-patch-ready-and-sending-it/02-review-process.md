## $\textnormal{The Review Process}$

> - Your patch will get comments from reviewers with <br />
    suggestions for improvements and, in some cases, <br />
    learning to know more about the change itself.

> - Please be patient and wait for a minimum of one <br />
    week before requesting a response.

> - During merge windows and other busy times, it <br />
    might take longer than a week to get a response.

> - Also, make sure you sent the patch to the right <br />
    recipients.

> - Please thank the reviewers for their comments and <br />
    address them.

> - Don’t hesitate to ask a clarifying question if you <br />
    don’t understand the comment.

> - When you send a new version of your patch, add <br />
    version history describing the changes made in the <br />
    new version.

> - The right place for the version history is after <br />
    the "---" below the Signed-off-by tag and the start <br />
    of the changed file list, as shown in the screenshot below.

> - Everything between the Signed-off-by and the diff <br />
    is just for the reviewers, and will not be included <br />
    in the commit.

> -  Please don’t include version history in the commit log.
