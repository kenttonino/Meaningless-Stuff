```plaintext
The intent is to encourage more use of the software and we want companies and individuals to use,
modify and distribute this software. We want to work with users in an open and transparent way to
eliminate any uncertainty about our expectations regarding compliance or enforcement that might
limit adoption of our software. We view legal action as a last resort, to be initiated only when
other community efforts have failed to resolve the problem.
