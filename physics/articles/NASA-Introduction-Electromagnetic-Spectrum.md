`Electromagnetic Energy`
#

> - It travels in waves and spans a broad spectrum from very long radio waves to very short gamma rays.
> - The human eye can only detect only a small portion of this spectrum called visible light.
> - A radio detects a different portion of the spectrum, and an x-ray machine uses yet another portion.
> - When you tune your radio, watch TV, send a text message, or pop popcorn in a microwave oven, you are using electromagnetic energy.
